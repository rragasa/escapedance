<p class="green"> Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin
        literature
        from
        45
        BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked
        up
        one
        of
        the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in
        classical
        literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus
        Bonorum
        et
        Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics,
        very
        popular
        during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section
        1.10.32.</p>
